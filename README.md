# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting plant diseases from leaf images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The system preprocesses leaf images, trains a deep learning model, and predicts disease categories with high accuracy.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** New Plant Diseases Dataset (Kaggle)  
- Includes healthy and diseased leaf images of multiple plant species  
- Images are stored in class-wise folders  
- All images are resized to **256 × 256** and normalized before training
